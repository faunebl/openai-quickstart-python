    prompt: In comparison to others, are you a person who is generally willing to
      give up something today in order to benefit from that in the future or are you
      not willing to do so? Please use a scale from 0 to 10, where a 0 means you are
      completely unwilling to give up something today and a 10 means you are very
      willing to give up something today. You can also use the values in-between to
      indicate where you fall on the scale.

    prompt: 'Please consider the following situation: You participate in a game. This
      game has the following rules: First, you are assigned a co-player. You do not
      know your co-player, and you will never meet him or her. Both of you get 100
      Euro each. You can transfer any part of that amount to your co-player. According
      to the rules of the game, your co-player will receive the tripled amount of
      your transfer. Then, your co-player can transfer any part of his or her total
      amount back to you. You and your co-player cannot communicate or meet at any
      point during the game. After the game, your ways will part and you will never
      know who your co-player was. We would like to know the following: How much would
      you transfer to your co-player. (Please respond with a number only.)'

      I would give the bottle for 20 Euro. This is a nice gesture to show your appreciation

    prompt: 'Imagine the following situation: together with a person whom you do not
      know you won 100 Euro in a lottery. The rules stipulate the following: One of
      you has to make a proposal about how to divide the 100 Euro between you two.
      The other one gets to know the proposal and has to decide between two options.
      He or she can accept the proposal or reject it. If he or she accepts the proposal,
      the money is divided according to the proposal. If he or she rejects the proposal,
      both receive nothing. Assuming, the other person has to make a proposal about
      how to split the money, and you have to decide about whether to accept or reject
      the proposal. What is the minimum amount the other person has to offer you so
      that you are willing to accept it? (Values between 0 and 100 are allowed.)'
