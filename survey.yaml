            not know your co-player, and you will never meet him or her. Both of 
            you get 100 Euro each. You can transfer any part of that amount to your 
            co-player. According to the rules of the game, your co-player will receive 
            the tripled amount of your transfer. Then, your co-player can transfer 
            any part of his or her total amount back to you. You and your co-player 
            cannot communicate or meet at any point during the game. After the 
            game, your ways will part and you will never know who your co-player

            you do not know, both participate in a study where you can decide on
            how to assign a certain amount of money and thereby determine the
            outcome. The rules are as follows. Both participants get an account with
            20 Euros. At the beginning, both participants thus own 20 Euros. The
            other person decides first. She can transfer money to your account. She
            can transfer any amount: 0, 1, 2 Euro, etc. up to 20 Euro. Each Euro
            that she transfers to you is tripled by the conductors of the study and
            booked to your account. After this first stage the other person therefore
            has 20 Euro minus the amount she transferred to you in her account. You
            have 20 Euro plus the tripled amount of the transfer of the other person
            on your account. Now you get to decide: you have the opportunity to
            transfer money back to the other person. You can transfer any amount up
            to 80 Euro, depending on how much you have in your account. This will
            be the end of the study and the account balances will be final. The other
            person has in her account 20 Euros minus the amount she transferred to
            you plus the amount you transferred back. You have 20 Euro plus the
            tripled amount of what the other person transferred to you minus the
            amount you transferred back to her. We would like to know how much
            you would choose to transfer back to the other person, for a given transfer
            of her to you.
            Suppose the other person transfers $amount Euro to your account.
